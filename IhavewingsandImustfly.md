This is my data science tools project. When I finished with my mathematics degree I wanted to go into data science to see how the real world was dealing with statistics. Live did not disappoint, it showed me exactly how mathematics and data science was applied in practice: with tons of software road blocks. The purpose of this collection is then to help you and me discover the tools that can make your data science life a lot easier, and hopefully helps you unlock your actual potential in doing the maths stuff and not the sads stuff... 

Also I will look into improving my puns ;p
