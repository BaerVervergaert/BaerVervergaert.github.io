Hi! I'm Baer a mathematician and data nerd with a passion for art. I've studied mathematics for nine years. During my studies I developed an interest in learning theory and extracting knowledge from data; not just statistics but also possibility theory. I've also found a great love for the arts; music, storytelling, poetry. 

On this website you can find my blogs as well as some of my art. It's a display of some of my ideas and endeavors that I think deserve to be out there but I haven't found a suitable place and audience for.

You can find relevant blog posts and info via the menu. Particularly, go to 
- [I have wings and I must fly]({% link IhavewingsandImustfly.md %}): for software tool related blogs. Here you'll find information on various software tools used in the data community.
- [Data Sorcery]({% link DataSorcery.md %}): for data related blog posts. Here you'll find models and data science projects.
- [Mathemagics]({% link Mathemagics.md %}): for mathematical related posts. Here you'll find discussions of mathematics as well as some mathematical relevant posts.
- [Artistry]({% link Artistry.md %}): for some art projects that I've been working on. Particularly, images and poetry.
- [Mathematics and Art]({% link MathematicsArt.md %}): for some blog posts on modeling literature in a mathematical way.
- [Personal Blogs]({% link PersonalBlogs.md %}): for some thoughts concerning my personal philosophy, hobby projects or whatever else I cannot fit in the other categories.
- [About]({% link about.md %}): for a short summary about who I am.
