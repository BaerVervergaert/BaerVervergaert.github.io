Hi! I'm Baer a mathematician and data nerd with a passion for art. I've studied mathematics for nine years. During my studies I developed an interest in learning theory and extracting knowledge from data; not just statistics but also possibility theory. I've also found a great love for the arts; music, storytelling, poetry. As you peruse this website allow me to shed some light on these topics for you.

You can find here some of my blog posts as well as some of my images and poems. Its a display of some of my ideas and endeavors that deserve to be out there but haven't found a suitable place and audience yet.

You can find relevant blog posts and info via the menu. Particularly, go to 
- [Data Sorcery]({% link DataSorcery.md %}): for data related blog posts. Here you'll find models and data science projects.
- [Mathemagics]({% link Mathemagics.md %}): for mathematical related posts. Here you'll find discussions of mathematics as well as some mathematical relevant posts.
- [Artistry]({% link Artistry.md %}): for some art projects that I've been working on. Particularly, images and poetry.
