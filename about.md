I'm a mathematician by training. I studied from 2011 until 2021 at the Radboud University in the Netherlands. During my studies I specialized in Stochastics with particular attention payed to Learning Theory. Stochastics is the studies of randomized processes and systems. In this sense it encompasses probability theory and statistics, but also goes beyond to processes such as stockmarket models, forest models and disease patterns. Of a particular interest to me was AI (artificial intelligence) and I've defoted part of my studies to that subject.

I have become particularly interested in:
- Online Learning Theory
- Statistics
- Machine Learning in Practice
- Quantum Computation
- Possibility Theory

Following my studies I have worked for a short time as a Mendix developer, figured that pure coding wasn't for me and doubled down on getting the pratical skills needed for Data Science. Currently I am unemployed and looking for work in the data sector.

In my data science efforts I have started working on time series models, text-generation models and image restoration. In maintaining this blog I hope to share some of my findings with the world, particularly with those interested in advancing data science and its relation with mathematics. I hope you'll find here something to your liking!!
